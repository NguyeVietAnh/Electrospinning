# Electrospinning - Make stuff great again ! 
Thesis
 Hi every one, I am Viet Anh, this is my project about electrospinning system base on ARM STM32F103 which I use for control motor with PID and using OLED LCD to display. 
 Hope everybody can join with my project !
 

 # Electrospinning Project





## Instructions

Electrospinning is a simple electrohydrodynamic process used to produce fibers. The range of these fibers are generally 100 of nm to 10's of μm, although it has been demonstrated to spin fibers on a very small scale of 10's of nm. With the Spraybase® instrument, the fibers are collected in the form of a non-woven membrane. Electrospinning produces fibers and fibrous membranes which are employed in a wide range of applications, from tissue engineering and drug delivery to energy conversion and storage.
