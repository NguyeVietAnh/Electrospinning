# Electrospinning
Thesis

Electrospinning is a simple electrohydrodynamic process used to produce fibers. The range of these fibers are generally 100 of nm to 10's of μm, although it has been demonstrated to spin fibers on a very small scale of 10's of nm. With the Spraybase® instrument, the fibers are collected in the form of a non-woven membrane. Electrospinning produces fibers and fibrous membranes which are employed in a wide range of applications, from tissue engineering and drug delivery to energy conversion and storage.
