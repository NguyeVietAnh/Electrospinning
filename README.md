Bootstrap—a front-end framework using HTML, CSS3, and jQuery—is designed to help developers quickly and easily build responsive, mobile-ready websites that are cross-browser compatible. An open-source framework, Bootstrap features a 12-column grid and components that are ready to use. In this course, Ray Villalobos helps you get started with Bootstrap by providing an overview of all of the goodies in this popular framework. Ray covers the installation options, and walks through the basic styles that normalize how your content is displayed on different platforms and browsers. He also explains how to use the flexbox grid system to build nearly any kind of layout you can dream up, use different classes to easily get around your project, work with interactive components like dropdowns and carousels, and more.

## Instructions

Electrospinning is a simple electrohydrodynamic process used to produce fibers. The range of these fibers are generally 100 of nm to 10's of μm, although it has been demonstrated to spin fibers on a very small scale of 10's of nm. With the Spraybase® instrument, the fibers are collected in the form of a non-woven membrane. Electrospinning produces fibers and fibrous membranes which are employed in a wide range of applications, from tissue engineering and drug delivery to energy conversion and storage. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspod to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course. 

## Documentation
If there are slides for this course, they will be available using the `gh-pages` branch. You can easily get to the slides by going to http://raybo.org/bootstrap4. The slides were created using [rayveal.js](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/rayveal) an opinionated version of the excellent reveal.js framework. Within these slides you can also read my notes for the project, just hit `ctrl-m` to get a menu with all of the slides for the project.
